to [Semantic Versioning][semver].

## [1.0.0][] - 2022-10-29
### Added
- The Disguise effect (from a rogue's pickpocketing glyph) now also triggers the
popup.

### Changed
- The popup now uses the buff's name rather than the item's name.

## [0.1.2][] - 2021-11-23
### Added
- A license file. The addon is now licensed under version 3 of the GNU General
Public License. If you are not a software developer, you don't have to care
about this - you are free to use and distribute the addon.
- "Shields" are added to the readme file in the repository to display the latest
version, its download count and the license.
- (Code) A script to copy the addon to the WoW addons folder for testing.

### Changed
- Updated for World of Warcraft 9.1.5.
- Release notes are now automatically generated from the changelog.
- The folder structure of the repository has changed. If you were using
automated scripts to update this addon, those may have ceased to work. Addon
managers such as Ajour, Overwolf, WoWUp etc. should still work fine with this
addon. If you don't know what this all means, the change likely won't affect you
at all.

### Fixed
- Fixed the changelog's format.

## [0.1.1][] - 2021-07-13
### Added
- You will now be notified when the Reflecting Prism effect has 30 seconds or
less remaining.

### Changed
